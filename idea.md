# Prerequisites
This is my first hardware related project, so I need detailed guidance.
It must be completed before February, 15th, including ordering and shipping of the components and printing out the enclosure.

VibeCube is a gift to my 2 friends DJs. They spend a lot of time creating their music.

Each track can take up to 100 hours. I think this effort deserves a physical representation. I decided to build the following devices:

# Main Flow
A black cube with a spot to insert NFC card. Each NFC card represents one of their tracks, listed on SoundCloud.
Cubes don't have a speaker, but connect to the Bluetooth speaker.
When one of them inserts a card with the track into the cube, another cube is notified that "Cube invites to join the vibe". Another person must insert the same card. Once both of them are inserted, then the track plays "simoulteneously" and they are "vibing" together.
